- 👋 Hi, I’m @jmmaski
- 👀 I’m an AppSec architect with knowledge of processes and frameworks, and a sailor.
- 🌱- I’m currently learning hands-on software engineering skills - Python, Docker, orchestrators, and the like.
- 💞️ On the sailing front - I'm working on tapping into my boat's NMEA2k network so as to correlate environmental data from the boat and NOAA predictive and current data sources to better understand sailing physics with a rough goal of being able to generate more accurate and actionable polars for any boat. Actionable == generate and feed ML_based commands to an autopilot, for instance. 
- 📫 How to reach me ...
